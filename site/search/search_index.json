I am a 3rd year PhD Researcher in Computer Vision & AI at the University of Lille. My research focuses on neuromorphic engineering, spiking neural networks , energy-efficient AI, and event cameras. Apart from research, I am interested in data-centric practices. During my early career, I intend to bring the power of MLOps into the Computer Vision field. I also like web and game development so you may possibily see such subjects here.","title":"Welcome to my place!"},{"location":"#welcome-to-my-place","text":"I am a 3rd year PhD Researcher in Computer Vision & AI at the University of Lille.
